GFS -> WindCube ingest (production). For each planned balloon it derives the
forecast region / pressure level / time window from Supabase telemetry (mirroring
the app's boundsForForecast + chooseGridStep + snapPressure so the cube matches
what computeMonteCarloForecast asks for), then builds a multi-cycle cube from
NOAA's free NODD S3 (byte-range U/V via the .idx: past 3-hourly *analyses* +
forward *forecast* from the latest cycle) and writes it to .windcube/cubes/.

Which balloons: the plan written by scripts/plan_forecasts.ts (FORECAST_PLAN,
default .windcube/plan.json) — the devices it marked `build`; without a fresh
plan (local runs) the legacy fleet query (status=flying, connected) or the one
requested device. What was built is appended to the ingest manifest
(FORECAST_MANIFEST, default .windcube/manifest.json) for the compute step and
the job summary. scripts/compute_forecasts.ts then reads the cubes from disk.

Env: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, FORECAST_PLAN, FORECAST_MANIFEST.
