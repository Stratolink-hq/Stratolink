 * The worker's only gate used to be the manual `devices.status = 'flying'` flag,
 * so a bench unit or a long-lost balloon was re-ingested (GFS + 31 GEFS + 31
 * AIGEFS member cubes, ~15 GB) four times a day for months, producing exactly the
 * same forecast each time. A forecast is a fixed function of history once the
 * balloon's last fix is older than the dead-reckon cap: the tube then ends at
 * `last_fix + DEAD_RECKON_CAP_H` with no forward leg, and every field it samples
 * comes from a past NOAA cycle, which is immutable once published. Re-running it
 * can only reproduce the stored forecast.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O. The plan script gathers the inputs and writes the plan JSON that
 * gfs_ingest.py / gefs_ingest.py / aigefs_ingest.py / compute_forecasts.ts read.
