Download and extract the complete project, or copy the library bundle beside the matching KiCad files. The bundles include the added R24–R27, C22/C23 and U8 footprints.

The November 8 revision corrects C15/R21 assembly clearance, adds U2 body/courtyard outlines and moves R11 for GNSS module clearance. R1 now uses **UNI-ROYAL 0402WGF7504TCE / C423135**, with the same 7.50 MΩ value and ±1% tolerance. Its procurement fields changed in the PCB and schematic; the circuit is unchanged. The replacement cart is saved and verified for five PCBs and three assembled pilots. No replacement order has been submitted or paid, and manufacturing has not been approved. Cancellation of the previous Y27 order has been requested but is not yet confirmed.

## Flown v1 components (historical)
1. [RAK3172-9-SM-NI](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C18548052.html?s_z=n_RAK3172) LoRaWAN Module (STM32WLE5)
    - Exact BOM part is RAK's 9xx MHz SKU for US915/AU915/KR920/AS923; EU868 is assigned to the separate `-8` SKU. The wire monopole is modeled across 868/915/923 MHz, but antenna bandwidth does not qualify the module's internal RF matching. Flight-3 EU868 reception is operating evidence only pending conducted/cold RF qualification.
    -     [4269](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/4269/10313908) sprint antenna
    - Can use STM32's `VREFINT ADC` for voltage monitor on both solar cells and supercap
    - 1.69µA sleep current
2. uBlox [MAX-M10S-00B](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C4153167.html?s_z=n_u-blox%2520Max%2520m10s)
    - no EEPROM, need something like `CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL=8` sent after each restart
    - 262,000 ft upper bound - COCOM compliant
3. Power
    - [Solar Cell](https://www.zachtek.com/product-page/copy-of-solar-cell-for-pico-balloons-polymer-4-8v-50ma)
        - x2 4.8V/50mA cells
    - [BQ25570](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C506250.html?s_z=n_BQ25570)
        - TI nano-power PMIC, 330mV cold start
    - [DMF4B5R5G105M3DTA0](https://www.cap-xx.com/products/dmf4b5r5g105m3dta0)
        - 1F, 5.5V, 40mΩ ESR
        - Qualification warning: the production BQ25570 divider is 8.25 MΩ /
          4.22 MΩ using ±1% parts. Its 5.363 V nominal threshold is not a
          tolerance-safe 5.5 V bound; the conservative source audit reaches
          5.544 V before resistor temperature coefficients and 5.592 V across
          the BQ25570 operating range. Keep the current payload shaded until the divider is
          lowered/qualified or a calibrated controlled-light test establishes
          adequate exact-assembly margin. See
          `analysis/diagnostics/supercap_charge_ceiling_audit.py`.
        - Source-screened rework candidate: Vishay
          `CRCW04027M50FKED` (7.50 MΩ, 0402, ±1%, ±100 ppm/K), the same
          lead-free D/CRCW e3 family as R2. The modeled -40..85 °C upper bound
          is 5.251917 V, leaving 248.083 mV to 5.5 V. With CAP-XX's ±4%
          internal cell matching, the worst initial cell screen is 2.730997 V,
          only 19.003 mV below 2.75 V. This is not assembly
          qualification: verify delivered identity, clean the high-impedance
          divider before C5 installation, and measure the fitted threshold.
        - Hard balance gate: this is a dual-cell, three-terminal part, but PCB
          pad 3 is unconnected. CAP-XX says it supplies no internal balance and
          highly recommends balancing for every series-connected module. Do
          not install C5 until an application-specific low-leakage midpoint
          network is designed and the darkness budget is updated. See
          `analysis/diagnostics/supercap_balance_audit.py`.
        - One active-balance candidate from CAP-XX AN1002 is TI
          `TLV8801DBVT` (SOT-23-5, -40..125 °C) and two Vishay
          `MCA1206MD1005BP100` 10 MΩ / 0.1% / 25 ppm/K resistors, with CAP-XX's
          22 Ω midpoint resistor. The TI maximum quiescent-current screen is
          0.952 µA including the reference divider and lowers the same
          baseline-only runtime to 9.115 h. This is not yet a buildable flight
          ECO: the full-screen initial mismatch asks for 4.774 mA while TI
          specifies 4.7 mA only as a typical short-circuit value. Use a
          qualified daughterboard/flex and prove startup, saturation,
          correction time, RF stability, and both cell voltages before fitting
          C5; do not dead-bug an unreviewed circuit onto the flight board.
        - A second, purpose-built candidate is ALD `ALD910025SALI`, a dual
          supercapacitor auto-balancing MOSFET in SOIC-8. It eliminates the
          always-on divider/op-amp and falls toward pA current below threshold.
          The source-bound typical model gives about 114.683 µA net
          equalization at the worst initial 4% mismatch and 9.298 h darkness
          runtime at 25 °C with the minimum 2.48 V threshold. This is not a
          worst-case guarantee: ALD limits the 25 °C threshold and channel
          offset, but its current curve and temperature coefficients are
          typical-only. The `SALI` rating also stops at -40 °C, 2.1 °C warmer
          than Flight 3's coldest telemetry. Treat it as a strong alternative
          for reviewed daughterboard/flex and HIL, not as a qualified drop-in.
          ALD's family data offers custom M-suffix -55..125 °C screening, but
          no exact ALD910025 military orderable is bound; obtain a quote and
          certificate, and remember that C5 itself remains rated to -40 °C.

          `analysis/diagnostics/STRATOLINK2_SUPERCAP_BALANCER_DECISION_20260725.md`.

## Notes
- The older 16-hour darkness calculation (`2 µA`, `0.5 V` drop, exact `1 F`)
  is superseded. The selected part is specified at 0.8-1.2 F, and the only
  board profile measured 33-35 µA with J-Link attached (a conservative bench
  upper bound, not a debugger-free flight value). From the present nominal
  5.363 V ceiling to the conservative 3.32 V Flight-3 reported plateau, the
  0.8 F part screens
  at 13.759 h for 33 µA with zero capacitor leakage, or 11.075 h for 35 µA
  plus the datasheet 6 µA room leakage limit—before GPS, sensing, TX/RX,
  watchdog wakes, cold, aging, or sag. See
  `analysis/diagnostics/supercap_night_reserve_audit.py`; fitted-cap darkness
  and recovery HIL is required.
- The 7.50 MΩ charge-ceiling candidate reduces the same 0.8 F / 35+6 µA
  baseline-only screen to 9.326 h before balance-circuit overhead. The
  source-bound TLV8801 maximum-current screen reduces that to 9.115 h before
  capacitor leakage beyond the 6 µA allowance or active GPS/radio cycles. Voltage
  safety, individual-cell balance, and darkness reserve must be
  closed together with the exact fitted capacitor; neither model is a launch
  qualification by itself.
- The ALD910025 typical-curve integral predicts 9.298 h at 25 °C and 8.962 h
  at 85 °C (using its 25 °C minimum threshold plus typical threshold tempco).
  Because those curves lack worst-case limits, measured exact-assembly
  darkness current remains the controlling gate.
- Standard FR4 (0.4mm maybe) is sufficient here
